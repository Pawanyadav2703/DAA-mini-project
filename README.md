# DAA-mini-project for Job Scheduling With Deadlines
This is a Python GUI application that implements the Job Sequencing with Deadlines problem using a Greedy Algorithm. The application allows users to input job details (ID, profit, and deadline), schedule jobs to maximize profit, and visualize the results in a graphical interface built with Tkinter.
